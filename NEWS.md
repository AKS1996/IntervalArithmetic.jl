# What's new in ValidatedNumerics.jl

## v0.1

v0.1 is the first public release of the package.

### Interval arithmetic
- Two methods for interval rounding are available:
 (i) narrow/slow (which uses hardward rounding mode changes for `Float64` intervals, and (ii) wide/fast (which does not change the rounding mode)
- The current interval precision and rounding mode are stored in the `interval_parameters` object
- The macro `@interval` generates intervals based on the current interval precision
- Trigonometric functions are "nearly" rigorous (for `Float64` intervals, correct rounding is not currently guaranteed)
- Inverse trigonometric functions are available
- Intervals of `BigFloat`s are displayed with the precision as a subscript numeral

### Root finding
- Newton and Krawczyk methods for rigorous root finding of 1D real functions are available
- Stringent tests are in place. (Due to an issue with Travis, tests with `Float64` intervals are currently not enabled.)
